# LabReport System

LabReport System is a web application that allows you to easily create, edit, and manage laboratory reports. This project is built using React with Mantine for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend.
## Features

- **Technician Authentication**: Login with email and password.
- **Report Management**: Create, edit, and delete reports with detailed information including file number, patientâ€™s full name, patient ID (T.C.), diagnosis title, diagnosis details, report date, and a photo.
- **Search and Sort Reports**: Search reports by patient name, ID, and technician name, and sort them for convenience.
- **Technician Management**: Add technicians in the system. Each report must be assigned to a single technician, though a technician can create multiple reports.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports multiple languages (Turkish and English).
- **Error Handling**: Form validation and global error messages.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Switch between dark and light themes.

## Deployment

Access the live version of the website at [labreport.sinandgn.com](http://labreport.sinandgn.com).

If the backend is down or the frontend is unreachable, you can still view the static version of the site at [static.sinandgn.com](http://static.sinandgn.com), which works without a backend connection.
